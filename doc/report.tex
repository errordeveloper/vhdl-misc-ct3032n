\section*{Introduction}

 The task of this homework was to learn
 VHDL design and verification by example.
 A selection standard digital circuits
 has been provided, of which a number
 of combinational and multifunction
 entities were implemented.

 Code verification and simulation were
 performed using \emph{Altera Quartus II}
 software suite with \emph{Mentor Graphics
 ModelSIM (AE 6.5)} simulator.
 Only basic RTL simulation had been
 carried out, without any timing constraints
 applied. The \emph{ModelSIM} test waveforms
 were generated using either GUI or Tcl scripts.

 The fallowing two chapters are describing
 the implementation for each of the design
 units, fallowed by source code listing\footnote{
 The comments were removed, since all the
 information is provided in the text. The
 source code can be also viewed and downloaded
 from online repository at the fallowing URL: \\
 \emph{\texttt{https://github.com/errordeveloper/vhdl-misc-ct3032n/}}}
 and simulation results.

 Most of the entities are using standard
 logic library (\texttt{IEEE.STD\_LOGIC\_1164}),
 unless specified.

\section{Comparator}

\subsection{Description}

 Comparator is a generic logic circuit that
 has two input ports and three single-bit
 outputs. Only one of each of the outputs
 may be asserted high at any given time.
 This design entity has two 4-bit inputs
 ($A$ \& $B$). When $A < B$, output $L$
 is high; when $A = B$ then $E$ is high;
 $A > B$ then $G$ is high.

 Behavioural VHDL implementation of this
 uses \emph{if-elsif} conditions. Currently
 it will only work for unsigned numbers
 of arbitrary bit-width.
